# CPP-Basics

A few basic C++ programs.
The Programs directory contains all the code. You can download the code and run it on your local system if it has a compiler or make use of a online compiler. Else, you can download the .exe files from the Executables directory and run them directly through the terminal (depends on your OS, if Windows, this is possible but Linux and MacOS need a few extra steps).

Enjoy...
